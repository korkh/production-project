## Project Architecture

The project is structured according to the Feature Sliced Design methodology

Link to documentation - [feature sliced design](https://feature-sliced.design/docs/get-started/tutorial)

---

## Working with Translations

The project uses the i18next library for translation work.
Translation files are stored in public/locales.

For comfortable work, we recommend installing a plugin for webstorm/vscode

i18next documentation - [https://react.i18next.com/](https://react.i18next.com/)

---

## Tests

The project uses 4 types of tests:

1. Regular unit tests with jest - `npm run test:unit`
2. Component tests with React testing library - `npm run test:unit`
3. Screenshot testing with loki `npm run test:ui`
4. e2e testing with Cypress `npm run test:e2e`

More about tests - [documentation for testing](/docs/tests.md)

---

## Linting

The project uses eslint to check typescript code and stylelint to check style files.

Also, for strict control of main architectural principles
uses a custom eslint plugin _eslint-plugin-ulbi-tv-plugin_,
which contains 3 rules

1. path-checker - prohibits the use of absolute imports within the same module
2. layer-imports - checks the correctness of using layers from the FSD point of view
   (for example, widgets cannot be used in features and entities)
3. public-api-imports - allows imports from other modules only from public api. Has auto fix

##### Running linters

- `npm run lint:ts` - Lint ts files
- `npm run lint:ts:fix` - Fix ts files with linter
- `npm run lint:scss` - Lint scss style files
- `npm run lint:scss:fix` - Fix scss style files with linter

---

## Storybook

For each component in the project, story cases are described. Server requests are mocked using storybook-addon-mock.

The file with the story cases is created next to the component with the .stories.tsx extension

You can run Storybook with the command:

- `npm run storybook`

More about [Storybook](/docs/storybook.md)

---

## Project Configuration

For development, the project contains 2 configs:

1. Webpack - ./config/build
2. vite - vite.config.ts

Both builders are adapted for the main features of the application.

All configuration is stored in /config

- /config/babel - babel
- /config/build - webpack configuration
- /config/jest - test environment configuration
- /config/storybook - storybook configuration

The scripts folder contains various scripts for refactoring\code writing simplification\report generation, etc.

---

## CI pipeline & pre commit hooks

GitHub actions configuration is located in /.github/workflows.
CI runs all types of tests, builds the project and storybook, and performs linting.

Pre-commit hooks check the project with linters, the config is in /.husky

---

### Data handling

Data interaction is done using redux toolkit.
Where possible, reusable entities should be normalized using EntityAdapter.

Server requests are sent using [RTK query](/src/shared/api/rtkApi.ts)

For asynchronous connection of reducers (to avoid pulling them into the main bundle) uses
[DynamicModuleLoader](/src/shared/lib/components/DynamicModuleLoader/DynamicModuleLoader.tsx)

---

### Feature-flags handling

Using feature flags is only allowed through the toggleFeatures helper function.

It takes an object with the following options:

```
{
   name: the name of the feature flag,
   on: function to be executed after the feature is turned on,
   off: function to be executed after the feature is turned off
}

```

For automatic feature removal, use the removeFeature.ts script, which takes 2 arguments:

1. The name of the feature flag to be removed
2. The state (on\off)

Here is example:

```
ts-node .\scripts\refactoring\removeFeature.ts isCounterEnabled off

```
