/**
 * This component is intended to be used as a wrapper around parts of the application that need dynamic loading and unloading of Redux modules (reducers).
 * It allows for a more flexible and dynamic structure where modules can be added or removed during runtime.
 *
 * @param props - The properties passed to the `DynamicModuleLoader` component.
 *   - `reducers`: An object containing reducer functions mapped by their respective keys.
 *   - `removeAfterUnmount` (optional): A boolean flag indicating whether to remove the reducers from the store after the component unmounts.
 *
 * @returns React component that dynamically loads and unloads Redux modules based on the provided props.
